# ðŸ§¹ Data Wrangling Project

This repository is part of a hands-on learning project focused on **data wrangling** using Python, particularly with the `pandas` library. It includes structured practice in reading, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing datasets from different sources.

Each topic is organized into a separate folder containing:
- Jupyter Notebook or Python script
- Related dataset(s) in `.csv` format

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

1. **Read in Data From Different Sources With Pandas**  
   Learn how to load data from CSV, Excel, and other formats using `pandas`.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values, fix data types, and clean inconsistent formatting.

3. **Basic Data Wrangling**  
   Apply filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation to explore the data.

4. **More Data Wrangling**  
   Work with merging, joining, reshaping (pivot, melt), and indexing.

5. **Feature Selection and Transformation**  
   Select important features, apply transformations such as normalization or encoding.

6. **Most Common Data Visualizations**  
   Create bar charts, line plots, histograms, scatter plots, and other basic visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
